# Zend Form Bridge for PHP Money

PHP Money is a dependency, located at: [github.com/moneyphp/money](https://github.com/moneyphp/money)

This library provides some simple tools and defaults for using Money and currency value objects with Zend's Form, validators and input filters.

The library is project specific, so it's not released on packagist, therefore if you want to use it, you'll need to add the repository to your composer config in order to install with composer.

Also, as it's project specific, it's intended to work on PHP 7.1 so some dependency version constraints are fixed at older versions, `zend-hydrator` for exampleâ€¦
